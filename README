I've been working on a small python tool that can be used to attach to 
the MNCC interface of OsmoNITB.  It implements the 04.08 CC state 
machine with our MNCC primitives, including support for RTP bridge mode
of the voice streams.

The first working version of the tool is available from
        http://git.osmocom.org/mncc-python/
or
        git clone git://git.osmocom.org/mncc-python

The code is pretty hacky in some places.  That's partially due to the 
fact that I'm much more familiar in the C, Perl and Erlang world than in
python.  Still I thought it's a good idea to do it in python to enable 
more people to use/edit/contribute to it.

I'm happy for review / cleanup suggestion by people with more Python-foo 
than I have.

Architecturally, I decided to do things a bit erlang-like, where we have
finite state machines in an actor models, and message passing between 
the actors.  This is what happens with the GsmCallFsm()'s, which are 
created by the GsmCallConnector() representing both legs of a call and 
the MnccActor() that wraps the MNCC socket towards OsmoNITB.

The actual encoding/decoding of MNCC messages is auto-generated from the
mncc header file #defines, enums and c-structures by means of ctypes 
code generation.

The immediate first use case for this was to be able to generate MT 
calls to a set of known MSISDNs and load all 14 TCH/H channels of a
single-TRX BTS.  It will connect the MT calls in pairs, so you end up 
with 7 MS-to-MS calls.

mncc_test.py currently drops you into a python shell where you can e.g.
start more / new calls by calling functions like
        connect_call("7839", "3802")
from that shell.  Exiting the shell by quit() or Ctrl+C will terminate 
all call FSMs and terminate.
